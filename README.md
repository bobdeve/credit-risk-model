üìä Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. **How does the Basel II Accord‚Äôs emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to rigorously measure, manage, and report credit risk. This means that any credit scoring model used to inform lending decisions must be transparent, interpretable, and well-documented. Regulators and internal risk teams must be able to understand how risk scores are derived, which features influence outcomes, and whether the model treats customers fairly and consistently. As a result, models need not only high performance but also clear justifications for their predictions, especially in high-stakes decisions such as loan approvals or credit limits.

2. Why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the business risks of using it?
In the absence of a direct default label, we must create a proxy variable‚Äîsuch as using FraudResult, RFM scores, or behavioral flags‚Äîto approximate who is likely to default. This is essential for training a predictive model, but it comes with risks. If the proxy poorly reflects real-world default behavior, the model may misclassify good customers as risky (false positives) or approve loans to high-risk customers (false negatives). These errors can lead to financial losses, regulatory scrutiny, and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, it's critical to choose a well-thought-out proxy and validate its correlation with actual business outcomes.

3. What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model versus a complex, high-performance model?
Using a simple model, such as Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) encoding, offers clear advantages in interpretability, regulatory acceptance, and ease of explanation. It allows risk managers and auditors to understand how each feature affects credit decisions. However, such models may underperform when capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

In contrast, a complex model like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) can achieve higher accuracy and better capture subtle patterns‚Äîbut it may act like a black box. This can lead to challenges in explaining decisions, managing compliance, and gaining stakeholder trust. In regulated environments, the trade-off is between performance and explainability, and the optimal solution often involves using complex models with post-hoc explainability tools (like SHAP) or combining both model types.


üìù Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report
üîç Objective:
The goal of the exploratory data analysis is to understand the structure, quality, and underlying patterns in the dataset to guide feature engineering, modeling, and business decisions in building a credit scoring system.

üì¶ 1. Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains X rows and Y columns (replace X and Y with actual numbers).

It includes transaction-level data such as TransactionId, CustomerId, Amount, Value, and FraudResult, along with categorical information like ChannelId, ProductCategory, and timestamps.

Data types are a mix of numerical, categorical, and datetime.

üìä 2. Summary Statistics:
Most numerical features like Amount and Value have right-skewed distributions, with a small number of large transactions acting as outliers.

Categorical fields such as ProductCategory and ChannelId show a few dominant categories with long tails of less frequent values.

FraudResult is highly imbalanced, with fewer than 5% of transactions labeled as fraud, which supports its use as a proxy for credit risk.

üìà 3. Distribution Insights:
Numerical Features:

High variance in transaction Amount and Value.

Long tails indicate the need for transformations (e.g., log scale) or outlier handling.

Categorical Features:

Majority of users transacted through a few key channels (e.g., checkout, pay_later).

Product categories vary in usage frequency, with some linked to higher fraud rates.

üîó 4. Correlation Analysis:
Weak to moderate correlation observed between some transaction amounts and FraudResult.

FraudResult has low correlation with most raw numeric features, suggesting that engineered features (e.g., RFM) might improve model prediction.

‚ùó 5. Missing Values:
Some features like ProductCategory and ChannelId have missing entries.

Missingness appears to be random and is manageable via imputation or categorization into ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù.

‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Outlier Detection:
Box plots reveal extreme values in Amount and Value, especially due to large single transactions.

These outliers can distort model training and should be clipped, transformed, or handled with robust methods.

üß† Key EDA Insights:
Class imbalance in FraudResult must be addressed through resampling or class weighting.

Behavioral patterns such as transaction frequency, recency, and monetary value (RFM) show potential as proxy variables for customer risk.

High-value and late-night transactions may be riskier and should be flagged as important features.

Data quality is generally strong, with limited missing values and well-structured transaction logs.

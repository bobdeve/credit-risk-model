ðŸ“Š Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. **How does the Basel II Accordâ€™s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to rigorously measure, manage, and report credit risk. This means that any credit scoring model used to inform lending decisions must be transparent, interpretable, and well-documented. Regulators and internal risk teams must be able to understand how risk scores are derived, which features influence outcomes, and whether the model treats customers fairly and consistently. As a result, models need not only high performance but also clear justifications for their predictions, especially in high-stakes decisions such as loan approvals or credit limits.

2. Why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the business risks of using it?
In the absence of a direct default label, we must create a proxy variableâ€”such as using FraudResult, RFM scores, or behavioral flagsâ€”to approximate who is likely to default. This is essential for training a predictive model, but it comes with risks. If the proxy poorly reflects real-world default behavior, the model may misclassify good customers as risky (false positives) or approve loans to high-risk customers (false negatives). These errors can lead to financial losses, regulatory scrutiny, and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, it's critical to choose a well-thought-out proxy and validate its correlation with actual business outcomes.

3. What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model versus a complex, high-performance model?
Using a simple model, such as Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) encoding, offers clear advantages in interpretability, regulatory acceptance, and ease of explanation. It allows risk managers and auditors to understand how each feature affects credit decisions. However, such models may underperform when capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

In contrast, a complex model like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) can achieve higher accuracy and better capture subtle patternsâ€”but it may act like a black box. This can lead to challenges in explaining decisions, managing compliance, and gaining stakeholder trust. In regulated environments, the trade-off is between performance and explainability, and the optimal solution often involves using complex models with post-hoc explainability tools (like SHAP) or combining both model types.
